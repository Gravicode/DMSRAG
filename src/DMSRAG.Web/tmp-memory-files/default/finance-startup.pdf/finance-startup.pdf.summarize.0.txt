Finance for startups includes accounting, audit, analysis, projections, and valuation. Accounting is important for decision-making based on the financial condition of the company. It functions like a dashboard, providing important information for controlling the company. It visualizes the financial aspects of the company, including assets, liabilities, and equity. The balance sheet shows the value of the company's assets and its structure, while the statement of changes in equity shows the net worth of the company. The general ledger records transactions in both the debit and credit sides, and each transaction should have equal amounts in both sides. Examples of ledger entries are provided for different transactions. The document also explains the importance of financial analysis in managing a business. It mentions the profit and loss statement and important financial terms such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, operating profit, indirect costs, and net income. It also mentions important financial ratios such as gross profit margin, net profit margin, debt to equity ratio, current ratio, debt to asset ratio, return on assets, return on equity, and capital expenditure.
